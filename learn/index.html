		<h1>Learn more about the Public Suffix List</h1>

		<p>The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate list of domain name suffixes.</p>

		<p>The usefulness of this can be seen if we take the example of cookies. Currently, browsers use an algorithm which basically only denies setting wide-ranging cookies for top-level domains with no dots (e.g. com or org). However, this does not work for top-level domains where only third-level registrations are allowed (e.g. .co.uk). In these cases, websites can set a cookie for .co.uk which will be passed onto every website registered under co.uk.</p>

		<p>Since there is no algorithmic method of finding the highest level at which a domain may be registered for a particular top-level domain (the policies differ with each registry), the only method is to create a list. This is the aim of the Public Suffix List.</p>

		<p>Software using the Public Suffix List will be able to detemine where cookies may and may not be set, protecting the user's data from theft.</p>

		<p>As well as this, the Public Suffix List can also be used to support features such as site grouping in browsers. By knowing where the user-controlled section of the domain name begins and ends, browsers can group cookies and history entries by site in a way that couldn't easily be done before.</p>
    
    <p>To take an example, the list of things for which Public Suffixes are
    used in Firefox 3 is:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Restricting cookie-setting (as explained above)
      <li>Restricting the setting of the document.domain property
      <li>Sorting in the download manager
      <li>Sorting in the cookie manager
      <li>Searching in history
      <li>"Responsible domain" display for some SSL certificates (not enabled by default)
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>In the future it may be used for, for example, restricting DOM Storage
    allowances on a per-domain basis.</p>
