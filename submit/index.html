            Submit amendments to the Public Suffix List
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make the Public Suffix List as current and accurate as possible, we request that TLD registries put in place processes to keep their section of the list current and accurate. This will make sure that all sites within their TLD continue to function fully within modern browsers, in terms of the site owners' ability to set cookies and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The procedure is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Carefully read about the <a href="/list/#list-format">list format</a> to see how the list rules are defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/list/">View the list</a>, find your top-level domain, and then check the rules already there for accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there are any additions, removals or amendments to be made, download the list file, make your changes and <a href="mailto:submissions@publicsuffix.org">email us</a> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format">unified diff</a> with a covering note.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please note that all emails must come from an address in your registry's official domain, otherwise they will be rejected. For each email received by us, a confirmation will be sent. The confirmation email makes sure that only genuine submissions are included in the list.
