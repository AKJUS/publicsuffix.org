        <h2>
            Submit amendments to the Public Suffix List
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make the Public Suffix List as current and accurate as possible, we request that TLD registries put in place processes to keep their section of the list current and accurate. This will make sure that all sites within their TLD continue to function fully within modern browsers, in terms of the site owners' ability to set cookies and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, owners of privately-registered domains who themselves
            issue subdomains to mutually-untrusting parties may wish to be
            added to the PRIVATE section of the list.
        <p>
            The procedure to make changes is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Carefully read about the <a href="/list/#list-format">list format</a> to see how the list rules are defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/list/">View the list</a>, find your top-level domain
                (if present), and then check the rules already there for accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there are any additions, removals or amendments to be made,
                the best thing to do is to create a pull request for our
                <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list">Github repo</a>.
                These days, you can pretty much do that using Github's GUI
                without even having to install Git.
                If that's not possible, then
                <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/issues">file an issue</a>
                on Github, ideally with a 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format">unified diff</a>
                attached.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Requests for changes to the PRIVATE section must come from the
            domain owner. Requests for changes to the ICANN section either need
            to come from the registry, or come with links to supporting
            official documentation.
