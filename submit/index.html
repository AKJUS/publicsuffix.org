            Submit amendments to the Public Suffix List
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make the Public Suffix List as current and accurate as possible, we request that TLD registries put in place processes to keep their section of the list current and accurate. This will make sure that all sites within their TLD continue to function fully within modern browsers, in terms of the site owners' ability to set cookies and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The procedure is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Carefully read about the <a href="/list/#list-format">list format</a> to see how the list rules are defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/list/">View the list</a>, find your top-level domain, and then check the rules already there for accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there are any additions, removals or amendments to be made, download the list file, make your changes and create a
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format">unified diff</a>.
                For fastest service, please attach that diff to a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&component=Networking%3A%20Domain%20Lists&form_name=enter_bug&op_sys=All&product=Core&rep_platform=All&short_desc=PSL%20update%20for">Bugzilla bug created using this link</a>
                (you will need a Bugzilla account), but we will also accept
                <a href="mailto:submissions@publicsuffix.org">an email</a> with a covering note.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please note that all emails must come from an address in your registry's official domain, otherwise they will be rejected. For each email submission received by us, a confirmation request will be sent. The confirmation exchange makes sure that only submissions genuinely from registry reps are included in the list.
